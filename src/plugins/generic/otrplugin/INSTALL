Off-the-Record messaging plugin for Psi

The plugin currently only runs with Psi+ (aka Psi-dev). If you don't have Psi+
installed on your computer, you can get it from http://code.google.com/p/psi-dev/

To compile the plugin you need to have installed the following libraries:
    - Qt4 or Qt5 (http://qt.digia.com/)
    - libotr2 (http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/)
    - TidyLib (http://tidy.sourceforge.net/)

Perform the following steps:

- Get Psi+ and apply the patches to the latest sources of Psi. Therefor you can
  use one of the scripts provided by Psi+.

- Make the Psi/Psi+ include files available to the plugin. To achieve this, copy
  the psi-otr-X.X/ directory to the src/plugins/generic/ directory of your
  patched Psi/Psi+ source tree.
 
- change to the psi-otr-X.X/ directory and run qmake to generate a Makefile:
  $ qmake

- Then run make to compile everything:
  $ make

The resulting binary is libpsi-otr.so. This file should be copied to the
plugins subdirectory of the Psi resources or Psi home directory. On Unix, 
this is usually /usr/local/share/psi/plugins and ~/.psi/plugins.


If you have successfully build the plugin, do the following steps when you run
Psi for the first time:
- Enable the plugin in the 'Options'-->'Plugins' dialog and click on 'Apply'.
- Set the OTR policy in the 'Config' Tab of the plugin options.
  In most cases 'Automatically start private messaging' should be a good choice.
- There is no button etc. to generate your private key. It will be generated
  when it's needed. I.e. when you start your first private conversation.
