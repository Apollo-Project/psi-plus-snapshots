This is a special repository with snapshots for Psi+ project:
  https://psi-plus.com/

Current address:
  https://github.com/psi-plus/psi-plus-snapshots

Description:
* Psi is a cross-platform powerful XMPP client designed for experienced users.
  User interface of program is very flexible in customization. For example,
  there are "multi windows" and "all in one" modes, support of different
  iconsets and themes. Psi supports file sharing and audio/video calls. Security
  is also a major consideration, and Psi provides it for both client-to-server
  (TLS) and client-to-client (OpenPGP, OTR, OMEMO) via appropriate plugins.
* Psi+ is a development branch of Psi with rolling release development model.
  Users who wants to receive new features and bug fixes very quickly may use
  Psi+ on daily basis. Users who do not care about new trends and prefer
  constancy may choose Psi as it uses classical development model and its
  releases are quite rare.
* Psi plugins are developed separately. Plugins API in guaranteed to be
  compatible only for git tags. In master branches of psi, plugins and psimedia
  repos they may be not in sync during development. Psi+ solves this problem by
  providing all-in-one tarballs in this special git repository.

Advantages of this repository:
* Sources are updated regularly (two times per hour) from all git repositories
  in according to their relationships (git submodules are bind to specific
  commits)
* There is no non-free content in the source tree.
* There is a transparent system of version numbering:
  - you don't need to calculate current version using magic hacks, just look to
    available git tags
  - you may download any previous version if you need and all parts of Psi+
    sources will be compatible with each other (main Psi sources, plugins,
    resources, etc.)
* Gzipped tarballs are available for each git tag. (Thanks to GitHub service.)
