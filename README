Here is a list of advantages of this repository:
* Sources has been updated regularly from Psi and Psi+ projects.
* There is no non-free content in the source tree.
* There is a transparent system of version numbering:
  - You don't need to calculate current version using magic hacks,
    just look to available git tags.
  - You could download any previous version if you need.
* Gzipped tarballs are available for each git tag.
  (Thanks to GitHub service)
